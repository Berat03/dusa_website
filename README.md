# DUSA Website

## Project Introduction

The current [DUSA](https://speleologicalassociation.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) (Durham University Speleodgy Assoccisation) website is a bit lackluster, has not been updated for a while due to it being inconvneitnent to update and doesn't present club activities in a manner that promotes the club. This project is creating a new website (with the permission of the DUSA executives) , with all the functionality tailored for their specific needs. 

## Objectives

- **Trip Reports**: We want the website to present the activities (i.e. trips) of the club, and having a trip report section (which is common in the sport) is a great way to advertise the club being active.
- **Archive**: A decades long historical archive of photos and newletters from past members (backuped and redundancy)
- **Visual and Interactive UX** To advertise the club to potential members
- **Admin Page**: So that non-technical users can interact with the page


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend** : HTML, CSS, Typescript, React.js (React because it's quick and there are a lot of resources and packages)
- **Backend** : Either Node.js or Django (I have experience in Django)
- **Database** : MongoDB or AWS (depending on pricing)
- **Deployment**: AWS (generous free tier)

## Development Logs
