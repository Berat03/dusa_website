# DUSA Website

## Project Introduction

The current [DUSA](https://speleologicalassociation.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) (Durham University Speleology Association) website has become outdated, lacking in dynamic updates and effective presentation of club activities. With approval from DUSA executives, this project sets out to create a new, tailored website. I aim to address these issues directly, creating a website that more accurately reflects the club and facilitates easy content management.


## Objectives

- **Trip Reports**: Introduce a section for showcasing club activities through trip reports, attracting prospective members.
- **Archive**: Create a (backed-up and redundant) archive for the club's extensive history of photos and newsletters, ensuring preservation and accessibility.
- **Visual and Interactive UX**: Develop a visually appealing and interactive website to effectively promote the club to potential members.
- **Admin Page**: Provide an easy-to-use admin interface for non-technical users to update and manage the website content.
- 

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend** : HTML, CSS, Typescript, React.js (React because it's quick and there are a lot of resources and packages)
- **Backend** : Either Node.js or Django (I have experience in Django)
- **Database** : MongoDB or AWS (depending on pricing)
- **Deployment**: AWS (generous free tier)


## Development Logs
